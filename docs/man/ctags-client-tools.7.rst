Hints for developing a tool using ctags command and tags output
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:Version: 5.9.0
:Manual group: Universal-ctags
:Manual section: 7

SYNOPSIS
--------
|	**ctags** [options] [file(s)]
|	**etags** [options] [file(s)]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
**Client tool** means a tool running the ctags command
and/or reading a tags file generated by ctags command.
This man page gathers hints for people who develop client tools.


PSEUDO-TAGS
-----------
**Pseudo-tags**, stored in a tag file, indicate how
ctags generated the tags file: whether the
tags file is sorted or not, which version of tags file format is used,
the name of tags generator, and so on. The opposite term for
pseudo-tags is **regular-tags**. A regular-tag is for a language
object in an input file. A pseudo-tag is for the tags file
itself. Client tools may use pseudo-tags as reference for processing
regular-tags.

A pseudo-tag is stored in a tags file in the same format as
regular-tags as described in :ref:`tags(5) <tags(5)>`, except that pseudo-tag names
are prefixed with "!_". For the general information about
pseudo-tags, see "TAG FILE INFORMATION" in :ref:`tags(5) <tags(5)>`.

An example of a pseudo tag::

	!_TAG_PROGRAM_NAME	Universal Ctags	/Derived from Exuberant Ctags/

The value, "2", associated with the pseudo tag "TAG_PROGRAM_NAME", is
used in the field for input file. The description, "Derived from
Exuberant Ctags", is used in the field for pattern.

Universal-ctags extends the naming scheme of the classical pseudo-tags
available in Exuberant-ctags for emitting language specific
information as pseudo tags::

	!_{pseudo-tag-name}!{language-name}	{associated-value}	/{description}/

The language-name is appended to the pseudo-tag name with a separator, "!".

An example of pseudo tag with a language suffix::

	!_TAG_KIND_DESCRIPTION!C	f,function	/function definitions/

This pseudo-tag says "the function kind of C language is enabled
when generating this tags file." ``--pseudo-tags`` is the option for
enabling/disabling individual pseudo-tags. When enabling/disabling a
pseudo tag with the option, specify the tag name only
"TAG_KIND_DESCRIPTION", without the prefix ("!_") or the suffix ("!C").


Options for Pseudo-tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``--extras=+p`` (or ``--extras=+{pseudo}``)
	Forces writing pseudo-tags.

	ctags emits pseudo-tags by default when writing tags
	to a regular file (e.g. "tags'.) However, when specifying ``-o -``
	or ``-f -`` for writing tags to standard output,
	ctags doesn't emit pseudo-tags. ``--extras=+p`` or
	``--extras=+{pseudo}`` will force pseudo-tags to be written.

``--list-pseudo-tags``
	Lists available types of pseudo-tags and shows whether they are enabled or disabled.

	Running ctags with ``--list-pseudo-tags`` option
	lists available pseudo-tags. Some of pseudo-tags newly introduced
	in Universal-ctags project are disabled by default. Use
	``--pseudo-tags=...`` to enable them.

``--pseudo-tags=[+|-]names|*``
	Specifies a list of pseudo-tag types to include in the output.

	The parameters are a set of pseudo tag names. Valid pseudo tag names
	can be listed with ``--list-pseudo-tags``. Surround each name in the set
	with braces, like "{TAG_PROGRAM_AUTHOR}". You don't have to include the "!_"
	pseudo tag prefix when specifying a name in the option argument for ``--pseudo-tags=``
	option.

	pseudo-tags don't have a notation using one-letter flags.

	If a name is preceded by either the '+' or '-' characters, that
	tags's effect has been added or removed. Otherwise the names replace
	any current settings. All entries are included if '*' is given.

``--fields=+E`` (or ``--fields=+{extras}``)
	Attach "extras:pseudo" field to pseudo-tags.

	An example of pseudo tags with the field::

		!_TAG_PROGRAM_NAME	Universal Ctags	/Derived from Exuberant Ctags/	extras:pseudo

	If the name of a normal tag in a tag file starts with "!_", a
	client tool cannot distinguish whether the tag is a regular-tag or
	pseudo-tag.  The fields attached with this option help the tool
	distinguish them.


List of notable pseudo-tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Running ctags with ``--list-pseudo-tags`` option lists available types
of pseudo-tags with short descriptions. This subsection shows hints
for using notable ones.

``TAG_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION``  (new in Universal-ctags)
	Indicates the names and descriptions of enabled extras::

	  !_TAG_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION	{extra-name}	/description/
	  !_TAG_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION!{language-name}	{extra-name}	/description/

	If your tool relies on some extra tags (extras), refer to
	the pseudo-tags of this type. A tool can reject the tags file that
	doesn't include expected extras, and raise an error in an early
	stage of processing.

	An example of the pseudo-tags::

	  $ ctags --extras=+p --pseudo-tags='{TAG_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION}' -o - input.c
	  !_TAG_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION	anonymous	/Include tags for non-named objects like lambda/
	  !_TAG_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION	fileScope	/Include tags of file scope/
	  !_TAG_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION	pseudo	/Include pseudo tags/
	  !_TAG_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION	subparser	/Include tags generated by subparsers/
	  ...

	A client tool can know "{anonymous}", "{fileScope}", "{pseudo}",
	and "{subparser}" extras are enabled from the output.

``TAG_FIELD_DESCRIPTION``  (new in Universal-ctags)
	Indicates the names and descriptions of enabled fields::

	  !_TAG_FIELD_DESCRIPTION	{field-name}	/description/
	  !_TAG_FIELD_DESCRIPTION!{language-name}	{field-name}	/description/

	If your tool relies on some fields, refer to the pseudo-tags of
	this type.  A tool can reject a tags file that doesn't include
	expected fields, and raise an error in an early stage of
	processing.

	An example of the pseudo-tags::

	  $ ctags --fields-C=+'{macrodef}' --extras=+p --pseudo-tags='{TAG_FIELD_DESCRIPTION}' -o - input.c
	  !_TAG_FIELD_DESCRIPTION	file	/File-restricted scoping/
	  !_TAG_FIELD_DESCRIPTION	input	/input file/
	  !_TAG_FIELD_DESCRIPTION	name	/tag name/
	  !_TAG_FIELD_DESCRIPTION	pattern	/pattern/
	  !_TAG_FIELD_DESCRIPTION	typeref	/Type and name of a variable or typedef/
	  !_TAG_FIELD_DESCRIPTION!C	macrodef	/macro definition/
	  ...

	A client tool can know "{file}", "{input}", "{name}", "{pattern}",
	and "{typeref}" fields are enabled from the output.
	The fields are common in languages. In addition to the common fields,
	the tool can known "{macrodef}" field of C language is also enabled.

``TAG_FILE_ENCODING``  (new in Universal-ctags)
	TBW

``TAG_FILE_FORMAT``
	See also :ref:`tags(5) <tags(5)>`.

``TAG_FILE_SORTED``
	See also :ref:`tags(5) <tags(5)>`.

``TAG_KIND_DESCRIPTION`` (new in Universal-ctags)
	Indicates the names and descriptions of enabled kinds::

	  !_TAG_KIND_DESCRIPTION!{language-name}	{kind-letter},{kind-name}	/description/

	If your tool relies on some kinds, refer to the pseudo-tags of
	this type.  A tool can reject the tags file that doesn't include
	expected kinds, and raise an error in an early stage of
	processing.

	Kinds are language specific, so a language name is  always
	appended to the tag name as suffix.

	An example of the pseudo-tags::

	  $ ctags --extras=+p --kinds-C=vfm --pseudo-tags='{TAG_KIND_DESCRIPTION}' -o - input.c
	  !_TAG_KIND_DESCRIPTION!C	f,function	/function definitions/
	  !_TAG_KIND_DESCRIPTION!C	m,member	/struct, and union members/
	  !_TAG_KIND_DESCRIPTION!C	v,variable	/variable definitions/
	  ...

	A client tool can know "{function}", "{member}", and "{variable}"
	kinds of C language are enabled from the output.

``TAG_KIND_SEPARATOR`` (new in Universal-ctags)
	TBW

``TAG_OUTPUT_EXCMD`` (new in Universal-ctags)
	Indicates the specified type of EX command with ``--excmd`` option.

``TAG_OUTPUT_FILESEP`` (new in Universal-ctags)
	TBW

``TAG_OUTPUT_MODE`` (new in Universal-ctags)
	TBW

``TAG_PATTERN_LENGTH_LIMIT`` (new in Universal-ctags)
	TBW

``TAG_PROC_CWD`` (new in Universal-ctags)
	Indicates the working directory of ctags during processing.

	This pseudo-tag helps a client tool solve the absolute paths for
	the input files for tag entries even when they are tagged with
	relative paths.

	An example of the pseudo-tags::

	  $ cat tags
	  !_TAG_PROC_CWD	/tmp/	//
	  main	input.c	/^int main (void) { return 0; }$/;"	f	typeref:typename:int
	  ...

	From the regular tag for "main", the client tool can know the
	"main" is at "input.c".  However, it is a relative path. So if the
	directory where ctags run and the directory
	where the client tool runs are different, the client tool cannot
	find "input.c" from the file system. In that case,
	``TAG_PROC_CWD`` gives the tool a hint; "input.c" may be at "/tmp".

``TAG_PROGRAM_NAME``
	TBW

``TAG_ROLE_DESCRIPTION`` (new in Universal-ctags)
	Indicates the names and descriptions of enabled roles::

	  !_TAG_ROLE_DESCRIPTION!{language-name}!{kind-name}	{role-name}	/description/

	If your tool relies on some roles, refer to the pseudo-tags of
	this type. Note that a role owned by a disabled kind is not listed
	even if the role itself is enabled.

UTILIZING READTAGS
-----------------------------------
See :ref:`readtags(1) <readtags(1)>` to know how to use readtags. This section is for discussing
some notable topics for client tools.

Build Filter/Sorter Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Certain escape sequences in expressions are recognized by readtags. For
example, when searching for a tag that matches ``a\?b``, if using a filter
expression like ``'(eq? $name "a\?b")'``, since ``\?`` is translated into a
single ``?`` by readtags, it actually searches for ``a?b``.

Another problem is if a single quote appear in filter expressions (which is
also wrapped by single quotes), it terminates the expression, producing broken
expressions, and may even cause unintended shell injection. Single quotes can
be escaped using ``'"'"'``.

So, client tools need to:

* Replace ``\`` by ``\\``
* Replace ``'`` by ``'"'"'``

inside the expressions. If the expression also contains strings, ``"`` in the
strings needs to be replaced by ``\"``.

Client tools written in Lisp could build the expression using lists. ``prin1``
(in Common Lisp style Lisps) and ``write`` (in Scheme style Lisps) can
translate the list into a string that can be directly used. For example, in
EmacsLisp:

.. code-block:: EmacsLisp

   (let ((name "hi"))
     (prin1 `(eq? $name ,name)))
   => "(eq\\? $name "hi")"

The "?" is escaped, and readtags can handle it. Scheme style Lisps should do
proper escaping so the expression readtags gets is just the expression passed
into ``write``. Common Lisp style Lisps may produce unrecognized escape
sequences by readtags, like ``\#``. Readtags provides some aliases for these
Lisps:

* Use ``true`` for ``#t``.
* Use ``false`` for ``#f``.
* Use ``nil`` or ``()`` for ``()``.
* Use ``(string->regexp "PATTERN")`` for ``#/PATTERN/``. Use
  ``(string->regexp "PATTERN" :case-fold true)`` for ``#/PATTERN/i``. Notice
  that ``string->regexp`` doesn't require escaping "/" in the pattern.

Notice that even when the client tool uses this method, ``'`` still needs to be
replaced by ``'"'"'`` to prevent broken expressions and shell injection.

Parse Readtags Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the output of readtags, tabs can appear in all field values (e.g., the tag
name itself could contain tabs), which makes it hard to split the line into
fields. Client tools should use the ``-E`` option, which keeps the escape
sequences in the tags file, so the only field that could contain tabs is the
pattern field.

The pattern field could:

- Use a line number. It will look like ``number;"`` (e.g. ``10;"``).
- Use a search pattern. It will look like ``/pattern/;"`` or ``?pattern?;"``.
  Notice that the search pattern could contain tabs.
- Combine these two, like ``number;/pattern/;"`` or ``number;?pattern?;"``.

These are true for tags files using extended format, which is the default one.
The legacy format (i.e. ``--format=1``) doesn't include the semicolons. It's
old and barely used, so we won't discuss it here.

Client tools could split the line using the following steps:

* Find the first 2 tabs in the line, so we get the name and input field.
* From the 2nd tab:

  * If a ``/`` follows, then the pattern delimiter is ``/``.
  * If a ``?`` follows, then the pattern delimiter is ``?``.
  * If a number follows, then:

    * If a ``;/`` follows the number, then the delimiter is ``/``.
    * If a ``;?`` follows the number, then the delimiter is ``?``.
    * If a ``;"`` follows the number, then the field uses only line number, and
      there's no pattern delimiter (since there's no regex pattern). In this
      case the pattern field ends at the 3rd tab.

* Find the 3rd tab, and count the delimiters between it and the 2nd tab. Notice
  that delimiters can be escaped, so only the ones with a even number
  (including 0) of backslashes before should be counted.
* If there are even numbers of delimiters, then the 3rd tab is the end of the
  pattern. If not, keep searching tabs forward until this condition is
  satisfied.
* From here, split the rest of the line into fields by tabs.

Then, the escape sequences in fields other than the pattern field should be
translated. See "Proposal" in :ref:`tags(5) <tags(5)>` to know about all the escape sequences.

Make Use of the Pattern Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pattern field specifies how to find a tag in its source file. The code
generating this field seems to have a long history, so there are some pitfalls
and it's a bit hard to handle. A client tool could simply require the ``line:``
field and jump to the line it specifies, to avoid using the pattern field. But
anyway, we'll discuss how to make the best use of it here.

You should take the words here merely as suggestions, and not standards. A
client tool could definitely develop better (or simpler) ways to use the
pattern field.

From the last section, we know the pattern field could contain a line number
and a search pattern. When it only contains the line number, handling it is
easy: you simply go to that line.

The search pattern resembles an EX command, but as we'll see later, it's
actually not a valid one, so some manual work are required to process it.

The search pattern could look like ``/pat/``, called "forward search pattern",
or ``?pat?``, called "backward search pattern". Using a search pattern means
even if the source file is updated, as long as the part containing the tag
doesn't change, we could still locate the tag correctly by searching.

When the pattern field only contains the search pattern, you just search for
it. The search direction (forward/backward) doesn't matter, as it's decided
solely by whether the ``-B`` option is enabled, and not the actual context. You
could always start the search from say the beginning of the file.

When both the search pattern and the line number are presented, you could make
good use of the line number, by going to the line first, then searching for the
nearest occurence of the pattern. A way to do this is to search both forward
and backward for the pattern, and when there is a occurence on both sides, go
to the nearer one.

What's good about this is when there are multiple identical lines in the source
file (e.g. the COMMON block in Fortran), this could help us find the correct
one, even after the source file is updated and the tag position is shifted by a
few lines.

Now let's discuss how to search for the pattern. After you trim the ``/`` or
``?`` around it, the pattern resembles a regex pattern. It should be a regex
pattern, as required by being a valid EX command, but it's actually not, as
you'll see below.

It could begin with a ``^``, which means the pattern starts from the beginning
of a line. It could also end with an *unescaped* ``$`` which means the pattern
ends at the end of a line. Let's keep this information, and trim them too.

Now the remaining part is the actual string containing the tag. Some characters
are escaped:

* ``\``.
* ``$``, but only at the end of the string.
* ``/``, but only in forward search patterns.
* ``?``, but only in backward search patterns.

You need to unescape these to get the literal string. Now you could convert
this literal string to a regexp that matches it (by escaping, like
``re.escape`` in Python or ``regexp-quote`` in Elisp), and assemble it with
``^`` or ``$`` if the pattern originally has it, and finally search for the tag
using this regexp.

Remark: About a Previous Format of the Pattern Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some earlier versions of Universal-ctags, the line number in the pattern
field is the actual line number minus one, for forward search patterns; or plus
one, for backward search patterns. The idea is to resemble an EX command: you
go to the line, then search forward/backward for the pattern, and you can
always find the correct one. But this denies the purpose of using a search
pattern: to tolerate file updates. For example, the tag is at line 50,
according to this scheme, the pattern field should be::

	49;/pat/;"

Then let's assume that some code above are removed, and the tag is now at
line 45. Now you can't find it if you search forward from line 49.

Due to this reason, Universal-ctags turns to use the actual line number. A
client tool could distinguish them by the ``TAG_OUTPUT_EXCMD`` pseudo tag, it's
"combine" for the old scheme, and "combineV2" for the present scheme. But
probably there's no need to treat them differently, since "search for the
nearest occurence from the line" gives good result on both schemes.
