<<<<<<< HEAD
New option: ``--describe-language=<language>``

    Prints the various aspects of the parser implementing the language.

New column, VER in the output of ``--list-{kinds-full,roles,fields,extras,pseudo-tags}`` options

    Indicates the versions of ctags output (or the parser) introducing the
    item in the list.

Extend ``--map-<LANG>=`` and ``--langmap=`` options to choose a parser using regular expressions

	``--map-<LANG>=[+]%REXPR%`` (or ``--langmap=<LANG>:[+]%REXPR%``) maps relative-paths
	that match the regular expression to the given language.

	The new ``--list-map-rexprs`` lists all regular-expression-based mappings.

	``--list-maps`` has also been extended to include regular-expression-based mappings.

    tokeninfo: fix null pointer crash in tokenDelete function
>>>>>>> 30b86e33a (NEWS: updated)

    The tokenDelete() function in main/tokeninfo.c was being called with NULL
    pointers from the R6 parser error handling code, causing segmentation faults.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Parser related changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------
JavaScript:

    * A new field "properties" was added to indicate that a field or
      member of a class is static.
    * Class member names prefixed with # are recognized as private.

C#:

    * Fix a bug that prevents the parser from extracting methods
	  if the method has nullable parameters.

Meson:

    * Extract config vars defined inside configuration_data({...}).
=======
    The R6 parser in parsers/r-r6class.c had a comment stating "tokenDelete
    accepts NULL" but the function did not actually handle NULL pointers safely.
    This occurred when parsing malformed R6 syntax such as:
    - R6::SomethingElse() (wrong function after R6 namespace)
    - R6:: (incomplete namespace reference)
    - R6::R6Clas() (typo in R6Class)

    The fix ensures ctags handles malformed R6 syntax gracefully by falling back
    to parsing assignments as regular global variables instead of crashing.

      Fixes segmentation fault when processing certain R6Class syntax patterns.

    fixup! C++: Update the parser version to 2.2

    In d469bf986acc7837514680434e90bc6087fe2827, I forgot to update
    versionCurrent and versionAge member of the parser.

    (This means the parser versioning of ctags-6.2 is broken.
    I must backport this change to ctags-6.2 and release 6.2.1.)
