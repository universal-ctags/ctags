Extending ctags with *xcmd*
======================================================================

:Maintainer: Masatake YAMATO <yamato@redhat.com>

----

*xcmd* means "External parser command".

Basic usage
---------------------------------------------------------------------
There are commands generating tags file specialized to a language.
`CoffeeTags <https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/CoffeeTags>`_ is an
example. CoffeeTags deals with scripts of coffee language. It is written in
Ruby. Therefore we cannot merge the parser into ctags
directly (Remember ctags written in C). However, the format of tags
file generated by CoffeeTags conforms to `FORMAT
<http://ctags.sourceforge.net/FORMAT>`. This means we can reuse
the output instead of reusing the parser source code.

With the new ``--xcmd-<LANG>=COMMAND`` option, ctags invokes ``COMMAND``
as an external parser command(xcmd) for input files written in
``LANG``. ctags merges the output of ``COMMAND`` into tags file.

By default the following executables are searched with following order for finding
xcmd ``COMMAND``:

#. *~/.ctags.d/drivers/COMMAND*
#. */usr/libexec/ctags/drivers/COMMAND*

These are called built-in search path.

On GNU/Linux more directories can be added with the environment variable
named ``CTAGS_LIBEXEC_PATH``. As same as ``CTAGS_DATA_PATH``,
directories can be set with ``:`` separators to ``CTAGS_LIBEXEC_PATH``.
When searching ``COMMAND``, ctags visits the directories before visiting
the built-in search path.

More search paths can be added with ``--libexec-dir=DIR`` option. ctags
visits ``DIR/drivers`` before visiting the directories specified with
``CTAGS_LIBEXEC_PATH`` and built-in search path. If ctags cannot find
``COMMAND``, ctags treats ``COMMAND`` as an executable file, and tries
to run it.

If an executable file as ``COMMAND`` needs to be specified explicitly,
use absolute (starting with ``/``) or relative path (starting with
``.``) notations.

Generally, an executable file ``COMMAND`` should not be specified
directly because ctags requires very specific behaviors (protocol).
Generally available tags generator like CoffeeTags don't conform with
the expected protocol. Executables under the built-in search
path are expected to fill the gap between generally available tags
generator and universal-ctags. This is the reason why the name
*drivers* is used as part of built-in search path.

To write a driver for a tags generator, please read
-"xcmd protocol and writing a driver".

xcmd v2 protocol and writing a driver
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is still experimental.
The v1 protocol was obsoleted.

list-kinds enumeration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ctags invokes ``COMMAND`` specified with ``--xcmd-<LANG>=COMMAND``
twice. Once when ctags starts and registers ``COMMAND`` for ``LANG``
to its internal database. Once again when ctags requests ``COMMAND``
to parse an input file and for generating tags information.

At the first time ctags calls ``COMMAND`` with following command line::

	$ COMMAND --list-kinds=LANG

The exit status and standard output are captured by ctags to know 
following two tings.

#. Whether ``COMMAND`` can be available or not.
#. Lists  the  tag  kinds  recognized by ``COMMAND``.

Availability is detected by the exit status of 
``COMMAND`` process; 0 means available.
If the status is other than 0, the ``LANG`` parser is treated
as ``disabled`` with warning messages. 77 is a special
number; the ``LANG`` parser is treated as disabled without
warning messages.

Standard output contributes to know the lists.
ctags expects following format when parsing the output::

  ^([^ \t])[ \t]+(.+)([ \t]+(\[off\]))?$

The output lines matched above pattern are recognized as follows::

``\1``

	kind letter

``\2``

	kind description

``[off]`` given after a kind description means the kind is disabled by
default.

Here is the example command line and output of ``coffeetags`` driver::

	$ libexec/drivers/coffeetags --list-kinds=coffee
	f  function
	c  class
	o  object
	v  var
	p  proto
	b  block	


Generating tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After getting kinds related information from ``COMMAND``,
ctags calls ``COMMAND`` with one argument, the name of input file::

	$ COMMAND input-file

ctags expects ``COMMAND`` prints the result to standard output.
ctags reads them via a pipe connected to the process of ``COMMAND``.

ctags expects ``COMMAND`` generates tags elements with enabling all
kinds.  Tags elements of disabled kinds are filtered by ctags side
when generating tags file.


Note for tags format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read `FORMAT <http://ctags.sourceforge.net/FORMAT>`_ about the
expected format of xcmd output. Format 2 is expected. Sort is
done in ctags side if necessary.

Tag lines in the output are merged to the final tags file with
filtering; some fields in the tag lines may be dropped if user
specifies ``--field=-`` option.

In addition to real tag informations, Pseudo-tag lines started
from ``!_TAG_`` are expected.

Following example is taken from ``CoffeeTags``::

	$ libexec/drivers/coffeetags /dev/null
	!_TAG_FILE_FORMAT	2	/extended format/
	!_TAG_FILE_SORTED	0	/0=unsorted, 1=sorted, 2=foldcase/
	!_TAG_PROGRAM_AUTHOR	Łukasz Korecki	/lukasz@coffeesounds.com/
	!_TAG_PROGRAM_NAME	CoffeeTags	//
	!_TAG_PROGRAM_URL	https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/CoffeeTags	/GitHub repository/
	!_TAG_PROGRAM_VERSION	0.5.0	//

ctags merges the Pseudo-tag lines with ``!LANG`` suffix::

	$ ./ctags   --language-force=coffee foo.coffee; cat tags | grep '^!'
	!_TAG_FILE_FORMAT	2	/extended format; --format=1 will not append ;" to lines/
	!_TAG_FILE_SORTED	1	/0=unsorted, 1=sorted, 2=foldcase/
	!_TAG_PROGRAM_AUTHOR	Darren Hiebert	/dhiebert@users.sourceforge.net/
	!_TAG_PROGRAM_AUTHOR!coffee	Łukasz Korecki	/lukasz@coffeesounds.com/
	!_TAG_PROGRAM_NAME	Exuberant Ctags	//
	!_TAG_PROGRAM_NAME!coffee	CoffeeTags	//
	!_TAG_PROGRAM_URL	https://github.com/fishman/ctags	/official site/
	!_TAG_PROGRAM_URL!coffee	https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/CoffeeTags	/GitHub repository/
	!_TAG_PROGRAM_VERSION	Development	//
	!_TAG_PROGRAM_VERSION!coffee	0.5.0	//

Integration to the source tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Put your xcmd driver under ``libexec/drivers``. This must be an executable;
don't forget dong ``chmod a+x``.

Currently an executable file is written as a sh script; I assumed a
driver may do a few very small things. sh may have enough functions
this purpose and have enough portability. If you need some thing
compiled language like C for writing a driver, we need to add targets
for building and installing the driver to Makefile.in. Remember sh 
doesn't mean bash.

Here is an example taken from ``libexec/drivers/coffeetags``::

	#!/bin/sh
	<<... copyright notices are snipped ...>>
	#
	#
	# This is a xcmd driver for CoffeeTags.
	# CoffeeTags is developed at https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/CoffeeTags .
	#
	#
	case "$1" in
	--list-kinds*)
		coffeetags --list-kinds
		exit $?
		;;
	-*)
		echo "unknown option: $1" 1>&2
		exit 1
		;;
	*)
		coffeetags --include-vars "$1"
		exit $?
		;;
	esac

An optlib file is also needed to let ctags know the driver.
Here is an example taken from ``data/optlib/coffee.ctags``::

	#
	<<... copyright notices are snipped ...>>
	#
	--langdef=coffee
	--coffee-map=+.coffee
	--coffee-xcmd=coffeetags

Finally you have to add these new two files to ``Makefile.in``.
Add the name of driver file to ``DRIVERS`` variable like::

	DRIVERS = coffeetags

Then add the name of optlib file to ``PRELOAD_OPTLIB`` or
``OPTLIB`` like::

	PRELOAD_OPTLIB =    \
		\
		coffee.ctags \
		...

If you add the optlib file to ``OPTLIB``, it will not loaded
automatically when ctags starts.


NOTE for writing a test case for xcmd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may want to test the output merged from a xcmd.
The test for xcmd should be conducted only if the xcmd
is available.

Consider a system where coffeetags command is not installed,
running test cases for coffeetags are meaningless. This
means a stage for checking the availability of xcmd is
needed before running a test case.

*Units/TEST/languages* is for the purpose. See "How to write a test case"
in "Using *Units*".
